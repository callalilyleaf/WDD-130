            <h2>Our first HTML</h2>
            <p>
              Let's write some HTML. Open VSCode, and make sure you are on the Explorer icon so you can see your folders and files. 
            </p>
            
            <p>We will only be using an index.html file and one image for this activity.</p>
            <p>
              Create a new file within wdd130 and call it index.html
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block fm">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="adding an index.html file"
                  src="../images/portal_file.png"
                  title="Creating an index.html file"
                />
                <figcaption>Create an index.html file inside of wdd130</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="callout" style="text-align: center;">
              <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong><span style="font-size: 2.5em;">&#9888; </span> When naming folders and
                  files:</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"> Use all lowercase, no capitals and also no spaces. </strong>
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>The editor will open the empty file. Use the shortcut of typing an '!' exclamation mark and then press tab or enter.</p>
            <p>HTML to create a basic web page will display.</p>
            <p>Inside the head section of HTML, the title tag will show up as the name or tab of the window in the browser. Inside the title tags replace the content with: WDD130 | Home</p>
<pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;title&gt;WDD130 | Home&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Everything inside the body tags will show up on the web page.</p>
            <p>Let's add a menu or navigation to our page. This should be inside the body tags. Type in the following &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;a&gt; tags with these attributes and content.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href="wwr/index.html"&gt;White Water Rafting Website&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="wwr/site-plan-rafting.html"&gt;White Water Rafting Siteplan&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="positioning.html"&gt;Positioning Activity&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Personal Website&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Personal Siteplan&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;                 
</code></pre>

            <p>Each page should have one &lt;h1&gt; tag with the main headline of the page.</p>
            <p>Add the h1 tag with your name.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;h1&gt;Firstname Lastname&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>Add an &lt;img&gt; tag so we can see an image of you on your page.</p>
            <p>Place an image file of yourself at the same level as index.html.</p>
            <p>
              Put your image right after the &lt;h1&gt; line. You will start
              with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Images require additional
              information in order to work however. We have to tell the browser
              where to find the image. We can use an "attribute" for this. The attribute
              we need is <kbd>src=""</kbd>. Add this right after the word
              <kbd>img</kbd>. So it will look like this:
            </p>

            <p>
              The name and path of your image will go into the "" after the
              <code>src</code>. Your file name will be whatever you named your image. The final tag should look something like this:
            </p>
<pre><code class="language-markup html">&lt;img src="myphoto.jpg" alt="Image of me"&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Notice that I included an extra attribute:
              <strong> <kbd>alt</kbd> </strong>. The <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute
              should contain a short description of the image. It is shown if
              the browser can't find the image or it is read for visually
              impaired visitors to your site. <strong>All</strong> of your
              images should have an <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute. If a tag has
              multiple attributes, the order of the attributes does not matter.
            </p>

            <p>Remember that actual .jpg file needs to also be inside the wdd130 folder at the same level as the index.html. You could place it inside an 'images' folder if you'd like, but it will be the only image for this page so it's OK if you leave it at the same level as index.html.</p>
            <div class="fig-block fm"> 
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="adding the image file"
                  src="../images/portal_files.png"
                  title="Include the image file"
                />
                <figcaption>Include an image file inside of wdd130</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>The image may render really large in the browser. That's OK. We will make it smaller with CSS later.</p>

            <p>Then write a brief paragraph or two using opening and closing &lt;p&gt; tags to tell a little bit about yourself. Here is a list of ideas to talk about to get you
              started. You don't have to write about all of them. Remember that this will be a public website...so
              don't put anything too personal or identifying.

              Each time you want a new paragraph (please break it into more than
              one paragraph!) Add a new

              When you have finished adding your paragraphs you will want to
              view your webpage. To do this right-click anywhere in the html file and from the pop-up menu choose 'Open with Live Server' and your default browser will render the html code and show your page as it would be seen on a browser.
